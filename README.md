### what Is
A collection of scripts for easy access from anywhere with Internet. If you're a 5cr1p7 k1dd13, then please do go figure out how to build versions of these scripts yourself before just throwing them around. These are not intended as a reosurce for making other humans' lives miserable, but rather as a set of tools for demos, teaching, and education. 

### how Do Contribute
If you have a script you'd like to contribute, it must simply be a bash script with proper syntax, and it must have an appropriate title ending in ".sh". For example, the script which contains the command ```echo "hello, world."``` is titled _helloworld.sh_. After you've performed those 2 _rigorous_ checks, then please do submit a PR with your script. 

### found Bug
If you find a bug in one of the scripts, or if you're unable to curl them from scripts.42eof.com, then please open an issue on this repository. 

happy scripting,

potc
