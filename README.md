### what Is
A collection of scripts for easy access from anywhere with Internet. If you're a 5cr1p7 k1dd13, then please do go figure out how to build versions of these scripts yourself before just throwing them around. These are not intended as a reosurce for making other humans' lives miserable, but rather as a set of tools for demos, teaching, and education. 

### how Use
Go [here](http://scripts.42eof.com) to start using the scripts, or use
```
curl -sL http://scripts.42eof.com/script_name | bash
```
To grab a script and run it in your bash console. If you do this, you take full and complete responsibility for whatever happens to your computer afterwards. Piping to bash is dangerous and should be done extremely judiciously. I repeat, I have warned you of the danger of doing this without being careful, and I take 0 responsibility for anything that happens if you execute a script on your or anyone else's machine. 

### how Do Contribute
If you have a script you'd like to contribute, it must simply be a bash script with proper syntax, and it must have an appropriate title ending in ".sh". For example, the script which contains the command ```echo "hello, world."``` is titled _helloworld.sh_. After you've performed those 2 _rigorous_ checks, then please do submit a PR with your script. 

### found Bug
If you find a bug in one of the scripts, or if you're unable to curl them from scripts.42eof.com, then please open an issue on this repository. 

happy scripting,
